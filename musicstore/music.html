        This is a day for the people who make up the world of the record store—the staff, the customers,
        and the artists—to come together and celebrate the unique culture of a record store and the special role they
        play in
        their communities. Special vinyl and CD releases and various promotional products are made exclusively for the
        day.
        Festivities include performances, cook-outs, body painting, meet & greets with artists, parades, DJs spinning
        records,
        and on and on. In 2008 a small list of titles was released on Record Store Day and that list has grown to
        include
        artists and labels both large and small, in every genre and price point. For several years, 60% or more of the
        Record
        Store Day Official Release List came from independent labels and distributors. The list continues to include a
        wide range
        of artists, covering the diverse taste of record stores and their customers.</p><br><br>
